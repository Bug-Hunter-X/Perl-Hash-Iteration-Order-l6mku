This repository contains a Perl script demonstrating an uncommon error related to hash iteration order. Perl does not guarantee a specific iteration order for hashes, which can lead to unexpected behavior if your code depends on a particular order.  The `bug.pl` script shows the problem, while `bugSolution.pl` provides a solution using a sorted keys approach.
